# Gradients

This Project Consists of Two Main Classes:

## Variable Class

The variavle class is essentially a class that is able to take any equation with 
multiple variables and evaluate it any point or take the gradient of it at any point

## LogisticRegression Class

The LogisticRegression class can fit any dataset to a logistic regression model and predict new values
